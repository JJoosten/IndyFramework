IndyFramework
=============

A simple OpenGL framework for personal use. 
The name is not a typo; I tend to name my frameworks with the names of our dogs! 

The framework is build on a small test bed that I used to make a simple OpenGL Compute shader in the end of August. 
This project can be found at: https://github.com/JJoosten/GLComputeTest
The code in this project will mainly focus on IndyCore and IndyGL.
